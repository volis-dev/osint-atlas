# TypeScript and ESLint Fix Tracking

## Date: June 25, 2025

### Phase 1: Initial State
- Created backup: `next.config.mjs.backup`
- Both TypeScript and ESLint errors are currently suppressed
- Updated next.config.mjs to enable error checking

### Phase 2: Analysis Results

#### TypeScript Issues Found:
1. **Duplicate Type Definitions** - Multiple components define same interfaces
   - Created `/types/index.ts` with shared types
   - Updated ToolCard.tsx to use shared types

2. **Environment Variable Safety** - Using non-null assertion operator (!) on env vars
   - This is addressed by the Supabase validation work

3. **Good TypeScript Practices Already in Place:**
   - All components properly typed
   - No `any` types found in codebase
   - Proper null checking with optional chaining
   - Event handlers properly typed

#### ESLint Issues Found:
Minimal issues detected - code follows React best practices:
- All hooks have proper dependencies
- No unused imports detected
- Components properly exported

### Files Modified
1. `next.config.mjs` - Removed error suppression flags
2. `types/index.ts` - Created shared type definitions
3. `components/tools/ToolCard.tsx` - Updated to use shared types

### Potential Risks Identified
- Environment variables could cause runtime errors if missing (addressed separately)
- Large fallback data array in page.tsx could be moved to separate file

### Summary
The codebase is already in excellent TypeScript shape. The main issue was that errors were being suppressed unnecessarily. With proper type checking enabled, the app should build successfully with minimal changes needed.
